# FamShare

FamShare is a free alternative to Dropbox, Google Drive or similar file sharing apps. 

It is nothing but a file sharing website that you can put on your own web-server so that you, and not Google own your data. 
For example, if you don't want Google or Apple to have all your pictures, you can put your pictures on a computer or 
raspberry-pi and host them through FamShare.

You can configure FamShare to fit your own needs, and it works out of the box. And although it is not the fastest,
(maybe you can help change that ;D ), it is password protected and easy to use. Great for the family!
